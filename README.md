Project Name: MediChain (Decentralized Medical System)
Objective: To facilitate the secure and efficient management of medical records using blockchain technology, allowing individuals and authorities to access and share medical history securely.
Integration: The Graph for querying decentralized data, NuCypher for data privacy, and NFT-based storage for immutable record keeping.

Problem Statement
In response to the global health crisis where traditional medical systems struggled, MediChain proposes a blockchain-based solution inspired by Taiwan's efficient use of medical and travel records to manage public health during the pandemic. This system will allow for real-time, secure access to medical histories, leveraging decentralized technology to ensure data integrity and accessibility.

Use of The Graph
Subgraph Design:
Entities:

PatientRecord: Stores individual patient data including medical history, treatment records, and permissions.
Hospital: Represents medical institutions, linked to records created or modified within their operations.
AccessEvent: Logs instances when records are accessed, detailing the accessor and the duration of access.
Relationships:

PatientRecord is associated with Hospital through treatment records.
AccessEvent connects with PatientRecord to log data access by various users.
Querying Mechanisms:
Patient Data Retrieval: Query patient records by patient ID, hospital, or date of record creation/modification.
Access Logs: Retrieve logs showing who accessed which records and for how long, crucial for audits and security.
Hospital Record Management: Hospitals can query the records they have added or modified, allowing them to manage patient data efficiently.
Use Cases:
Medical History Access: Patients and authorized entities can access medical histories in real-time, enhancing the response time and accuracy of medical treatments.
Secure Data Sharing: Enables sharing of medical data with restricted access using encrypted keys, where The Graph queries manage who can view the data and for how long.
Research and Public Health Monitoring: Aggregate data can be queried to monitor health trends and disease outbreaks, supporting public health initiatives and research.
Challenges Addressed
Implementing a role-based access control using NuCypher, integrated with querying through The Graph to ensure that data access is both secure and compliant with regulations.
Managing structured and potentially complex medical data across decentralized networks.
Future Extensions
Universal Health Coverage: Expand the system to support universal health care initiatives, using the scalability of blockchain and the efficient data querying capabilities of The Graph.
Advanced Medical Research: Utilize aggregated and anonymized data to fuel medical research, potentially predicting outbreaks and improving treatment protocols.
Conclusion
MediChain uses The Graph to revolutionize how medical data is accessed and managed, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency. The implementation of a custom subgraph has provided robust support for real-time data access and privacy-preserving mechanisms, setting a new standard for medical record management in a decentralized context.
